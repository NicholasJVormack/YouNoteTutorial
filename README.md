# NoteMaster

**NoteMaster** is a lightweight, full-stack note-taking application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to easily **create, read, update, and delete notes** that are paired with specific YouTube videos.

This project was developed by following the **YOUNOTE tutorial**, and serves as a hands-on exercise in building a functional CRUD app using modern web technologies.

## Features

- ✏️ Create, edit, and delete rich-text notes  
- 🔗 Associate each note with a YouTube video URL  
- ⚛️ Frontend built with React for a seamless user experience  
- 🌐 Backend powered by Express and Node.js, with MongoDB for persistent storage

## Purpose

This project was built to strengthen my foundational skills in full-stack development and gain practical experience working with the MERN stack through guided learning.

## Getting Started

> This project follows the core structure and logic of the YOUNOTE tutorial series. To get it running locally, clone the repository and follow standard setup steps for a MERN app.
